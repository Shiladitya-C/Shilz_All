Information :- As per new pension regulation, individuals born in 1963 and younger and who employed in a public service will earn up a retirement pension by accruing funds in a pensjonsbeholdning, which will be used for calculating new retirement pension, called påslagsordningen or Alderspensjon 2025.
Those members, who have been employed in the public sector and have earnings before 1st of January, 2020  and continue in a position as a public employee after 2020, will be paid a retirement pension as a combination of two different regulations for calculation.  Where the part of their earnings, accrued before 31st of December 2019, will be calculated according to the old rules and will be coordinated with the National Insurance Scheme. For individuals who only have earnings in the public sector from and including 1st of January, 2020 , a retirement pension will be calculated by following the new regulation and there will be no coordination with the National Insurance Scheme.
