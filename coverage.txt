 +

Test 2#: Covers requirement 4 (age aspect) and partially requirement 8 (30 years of income before 2020). + 
Test 3#: Violates requirement 3 (3 years of membership needed) and partially tests requirement 4. + 
Test 4#: Covers requirement 3 (3 years of income to apply) and partially requirement 4. + 
 + 
Missing Test Cases: + 
- A test case for an individual who has earnings in the public sector only from 1st January 2020, to verify the new pension calculation without coordination with the National Insurance Scheme (related to rule 2). + 
- A test case for members with earnings accrued before 31st December 2019 and after to ensure proper calculation according to old and new rules (related to rule 2). +
